Robert 'Bob' Belcher, Jr. is a third generation restaurant owner, following after his father, Big Bob. Throughout the 70's grew up working in his father's restaurant, "Big Bob's Diner", learning as he grew and eventually adapting his own creative style. It was in his early teens, at 14, when Bob got a true taste of what it was like running the business. While his father was away, Bob manned the grill and created his first burger, called the "Baby, You Can Chive My Car" burger, for one of his father's regulars. Then, in the early 90's, Big Bob decided to change the name of "Big Bob's Diner" to "Bob and Son's", but Bob refused and eventually started his own restaurant that became the "Bob's Burgers" you see today! He met his wife, Linda, in the 90's and they went on to get married in 1998 and eventually had three children: Tina, Gene, and Louise. At "Bob's Burgers", we always use fresh, good, quality ingredients that will have you coming back for years to come!
